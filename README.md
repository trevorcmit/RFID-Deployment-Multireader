# RFID-Deployment-Multireader

This repository is a private research repository used by International Fabric Machines to test the use of multiple readers in the BLE.Client project. The default setup is limited to a singular reader, and this code attempts to allow multiple simulenteous Bluetooth connections to CS108/CS463 class readers.
